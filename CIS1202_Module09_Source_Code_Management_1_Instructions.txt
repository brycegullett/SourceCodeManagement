CIS 1202 Programming Assignment #9
Source Code Management 1
Write a program that displays the text "Hello, World", check it into a source code management system,
modify the program, and check in the update.
You are free to use any distributed source code management system (no centralized systems) and any 
hosting provider.
The instructions here will be using the Git source code management system, the GitHub online service, 
and Visual Studio.  These are commonly used in businesses, so we'll use them here.
Note that online services and software applications change frequently, so be aware that these screen shots
 may be out of date.  I'm sure that you'll figure it out.
For most of this assignment, you'll just be following instructions.  Please take some time to consider 
why you're doing what you're doing, instead of just blindly following along.
Requirements
	
	•	Sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/  There is no cost to use this service.

	•	In Visual Studio, write the "Hello, World" program.

	•	Add this program to a new local git repository.
	•	Press the "Add to Source Control" button at the bottom of Visual Studio.  Choose "Git".
	•	Wait a short while; this might take a minute.
	•	Your source code is now being tracked by Git.  You can revert edits, view history, branch, merge, 
		and all of those source code management terms.  But, right now, it's all local, meaning it exists 
		only on your computer.

	•	Upload your project to GitHub.  This is called a "push" in source code management vocabulary.
	•	Turn on the "Team Explorer" window.

	•	Choose "Publish to GitHub.

	•	Sign in with the name and password you set up in step 1.
	•	Publish it.  Make sure that the "Private Repository" is not checked.

	•	Switch to GitHub, click into your repository, and see that there's nothing really there!

	•	You created a repository for this program on GitHub, but you haven't included any files yet.  
		That's why you don't see your program in GitHub.
	•	Commit your source code.  "Commit" means that your changes are ready to go.  
		(Don't commit any source until you're sure that it works.)  Files that are not committed won't 
		be added to the repository.  Switch back to the Solution Explorer, right-click on the source code file, 
		then choose "Commit...".

	•	Visual Studio will ask for identifying information.  I prefer to keep my contact information 
		private, so fill this in with bogus information.  Uncheck the global option, just in case you 
		want to use your real name in the future.


	•	Enter a commit message.  This is a short description of the changes that you made to the source 
		code.  Commit messages are extremely important, as this enables others looking at the repository 
		to know how a file or program has evolved over time.  Since this is the first commit, let's say so.  
		Type "First commit" in the text box.

	•	Press the "Commit Staged" button.
	•	Sync.  This will push this commit to GitHub.


	•	Press the "Push" button.



	•	View your repository online.  Go back to GitHub, and refresh the page.  Click into the folders to 
		find your source code file.

	•	Edit the source code in your browser on GitHub.  Make the program display "Hello, Universe!"

	•	Scroll down and compose a commit message for this change, then "Commit changes".


	•	Back in Visual Studio, let's get the updated source code from GitHub.  This is called a "pull".  
		Press the "Pull" button.

	•	The changes made in GitHub are now available in Visual Studio.

	•	Let's see the history of this repository.  Press "Actions", then "View History..."

	•	Click on the most recent item in the history, then right-click on the source code file, then 
		choose "Compare with previous" to see the differences between versions.


	•	See the differences side by side.

	•	Make your repository available to your instructor for grading.  Switch back to GitHub and go back 
		to the root of your repository.



	•	Choose the green "Code" button, then choose "Use HTTPS", then copy the link to your repository.

	•	Upload this link to the eLearn dropbox.  No screen shots or other documentation are necessary.  
		Just the link.
